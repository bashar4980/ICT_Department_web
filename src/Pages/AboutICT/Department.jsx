          The Department of Information & Communication Engineering was
          established in harmony with the progress of current information
          technology under the Faculty of Applied Science and Technology in
          1998. The Department is so underlying and contemporary because of the
          adaptation and uses of Information and Communication Technology is
          increasingly being linked to the national economic development and
          subsequent human development for the countries of the world. The
          Department first introduced in the Islamic University, Kushtia-7003,
          among all the universities in Bangladesh has already reached 20 years.
          With the help of modern and advanced software, hardware, electronic,
          communication laboratories and multimedia library, this department is
          being run in accordance with the various technical changes in
          technology as well as educational curriculum per year. In the era of
          globalization, the first and foremost purpose of this department is to
          create the appropriate information expert and technologist for the
          advancement of our country. The students who were graduated from the
          department are working in different positions with good reputation in
          home and aboard.
